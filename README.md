# Weather Dashboard

 ## Description
 This application was designed with the purpose of providing users with accurate and up-to-date information surrounding the weather conditions of cities from across the globe. Users can begin by entering the name of a city in which they would like to obtain the weather information. From here, the page will load the forecast of that day in addition to a 5-day forecast of that week. Information such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity will be displayed. Users will also be able to see their previous searches and be able able to call upon them to display that information once more.
